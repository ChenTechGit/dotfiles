### Credits
#### Fastfetch

2. Big config based on: https://github.com/Sk7Str1pe/Public
#### Neovim
I learnned to configure Neovim from these videos from [Josean Martinez](https://www.youtube.com/@joseanmartinez)
#### Other
[Stephan Raabe's ML4W config](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles) was helpful when I was configuring Hyprland

I stole and edited some configs from [Eric Murphy's dotfiles](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/dotfiles)

<h1 align="center">ðŸ“¦ Requirements</h1>

Make sure you have GNU Stow and Git installed on your system

## Git
Debian Ubuntu and Mint:
```bash
sudo apt install git stow
```

Arch based:
```bash
sudo pacman -S git stow
```

<h1 align="center">ðŸ“¥ Installation</h1>
First clone this repository in your $HOME directory with Git:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ChenTechGit/dotfiles
```
Clone the Testing branch with this command:

```bash
git clone -b Testing --recursive https://github.com/ChenTechGit/dotfiles
```

Now use GNU Stow to create symbolik links
`NOTE You need to delete or backup your existing dotfiles such as .bashrc`
```bash
stow .
```

## Old configs?
You may find my old configs in the [unused](https://github.com/ChenTechGit/dotfiles/tree/unused).
