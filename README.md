<h1 align="center">ðŸ“¥ Installation</h1>
> [!NOTE]  
> I often merge the Main branch and the Testing branch together, right after a commit.
First clone this repository in your $HOME directory with Git:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ChenTechGit/dotfiles
```
Clone the Testing branch with this command:
```bash
git clone -b Testing --recursive https://github.com/ChenTechGit/dotfiles
```

Now use GNU Stow to create symbolik links
`NOTE You need to delete or backup your existing dotfiles such as .bashrc`
```bash
stow .
```
