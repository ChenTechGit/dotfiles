<h1 align="center">ðŸ“¦ Requirements</h1>

Make sure you have GNU Stow and Git installed on your system

## Git
Debian Ubuntu and Mint:
```bash
sudo apt install git stow
```

Arch based:
```bash
sudo pacman -S git stow
```

<h1 align="center">ðŸ“¥ Installation</h1>
First clone this repository in your $HOME directory with Git:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ChenTechGit/dotfiles
```
Clone the Testing branch with this command:

```bash
git clone -b Testing --recursive https://github.com/ChenTechGit/dotfiles

Now use GNU Stow to create symbolik links
`NOTE You need to delete or backup your existing dotfiles such as .bashrc`
```bash
stow .
